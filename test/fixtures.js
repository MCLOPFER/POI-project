My brother & myself visited today (May 11) & it was a delightful experience enhanced by the member of staff who went way over & above to show us around & give us the history of the estate. Pity it isn't publicised more - we only discovered it by accident. It is really worth a visit."

This picturesque strand has starred in award-winning films Saving Private Ryan and Brooklyn. It’s a great spot to catch a wave or two – head over to the Surf Shack for rentals, surfing lessons and stand-up paddleboarding."

In recent years the park has been replanted with sessile oak, ash, birch, cherry and spindle as part of the Millennium forest project. Other flora to look out for are the bluebells that grow under the oak woodland. Proximity to Kilkenny means that the area is very popular with local towns people for walking. Coill an Fhailtaigh is a Millennium Forest."
